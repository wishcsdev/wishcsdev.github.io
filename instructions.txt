Checked on Chrome and Edge. 

On the Upper Right please click on Calc to open calculator

There is a bug which doesnt automatically scale the mobile version. However if you manually change the window 
size to less than 600px the calculator scales. I am not sure why this is the case. 

I have added a function where consecutive decimal points or ++ or ** are disabled. But this also means that 
you cannot reuse the operators until next time.
